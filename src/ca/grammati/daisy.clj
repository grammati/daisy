  `defcomponent` : macro for defining component-record types

     already-started component.

(defmacro
  ^{:style/indent [1 :form :form [1]]}
  defcomponent
  "Macro to define a component.

  Expands into a defrecord and a factory function.

  The record implements com.stuartsierra.component/Lifecycle such that
  the start and stop methods call daisy/start and daisy/stop.

  Parameters are:
  `type-name` - symbol, the name of the record
  `doc` - a docstring
  `opts` - map - keys can include:
      :init-args - vector of symbols. Becomes the argument list of the factory fn.
      :injected - vector of symbols. Defines the components that this component
                  depends on, and expects to have injected before it starts.
      :creates - vector of symbols. Defines fields that this component will set
                 values for in its start method.
      :factory-name - symbol. Specifies a name for the factory fn. If not set, the
                      name will be generated as \"new-\" + (camel->lisp type-name)
  `start` and `stop` - method bodies for the lifecycle start and stop methods.
  `body` - anything here will be added to the body of the defrecord. You can use
           this to implement other protocols.

  Example:

  (defcomponent Foo
    \"This is a sweet component\"
    {:init-args [blah]
     :injected  [bar]
     :creates   [foo]}
    (start [this] (assoc this :foo (flarp blah bar)))
    (stop  [this] (unflarp! foo) (assoc this :foo nil))
    IFunky
    (funky [this] (funkify foo bar blah)))

        fn-name (or factory-name (str "new-" (camel->lisp (name type-name))))

        stop    (cons '-stop  (rest stop))]
    (list

(defn system-map
  "Builds and returns a system-map containing dependency information
  extracted from the components in the given map.

 `defcomponent` expects you to declare, using the `:injected` option,
  a list of things that a component depends on. We can use this
  information to automatically generate the dependency map that is the
  second argument to component's `system-using` function.

  Note that this only works if you follow certain conventions: the
  sybol given in `:injected` must match the keyword used as the key in
  the system-map passed to this function.

  Example:
  ;; Given:
  (defcomponent Foo
    \"docstring\"
    {:injected [bar]}
    (start [this] ...)
    (stop [this] ...))
  (defcomponent Bar ...)

  ;; then:
  (daisy/system-map {:bar (new-bar) :foo (new-foo)})
  ;; is equvalent to:
  (component/system-using
    (component/map->System {:bar (new-bar) :foo (new-foo)})
    {:foo [:bar]})
